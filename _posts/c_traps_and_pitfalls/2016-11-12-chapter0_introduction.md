# Why Author wrote this book?
> The machine did exactly what I told it; it just didn't do quite what I had in mind.


> This book concentrates on this kind of problems


> **Programming** errors represent places where a program departs from the programmer's mental model of that problem. By their very nature they are thus hard to classify. I have tried to group them according to their relevance to various ways of looking at a program.




# Book Content
### 1. chapter 1 Lexical
This chapter will look at problems that stem form the way C lexical analysis is done.
### 2. Chapter 2 Syntax
Treats errors that can arise from misunderstanding these syntactic details
### 3. Chapter3 Misconceptions 
Deal with misconceptions of meaning: ways a programmer who intended to say one thing can actually be saying something else. We assume here that the lexical and syntactic details of the language are well understood and concentrate on semantic details.
### 4. Linkage 
C program is often made out of several parts that compiled separately and later bound together. This process is called linkage and is part of the relationship between the program and the environment
### 5. Library Routines
Although not strictly part of the language, library routines are essential to any C program that does anything useful. In particular, a few library routines are used by almost very C program, and there are enough ways to go wrong using them to merit the discussion.
### 6. Preprocessor
Although various preprocess implementations differ somewhat, we can say useful things about aspects that many implementations have in common
### 7. Portability
Reasons a program might run on one implementation and not another. It is surprisingly hard to do even simple things like integer arithmetic correctly. 
### 8. Advice and Answers
This chapter will offer advice in defensive programming and answers the exercises from other chapters.
